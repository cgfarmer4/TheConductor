    ///               which is when the RecordFrame signal must be given to the Recording session. Using this component,
    ///               we can use MonoBehaviour coroutines to inform the Recorder of the end of frame.
    /// 
    /// Notes: 
    ///     - There is a 1-to-1 instance count between RecorderPlayableBehaviour and WaitForEndOfFrameComponent
    ///     - This component get's added to a transient GameObject, that lives in the scene in play mode and that is associated
    ///       to the recording session.
